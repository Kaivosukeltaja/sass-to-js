It provides Sass methods to save Sass maps and list as JSON to CSS and

JavaScript helpers to read those strings from CSS to JavaScript objects.

* some variables values (e.g. theme colors, dimensions etc.)
* list of variable values which might be applied in some circumstances (columns count for different types of devices etc.)
